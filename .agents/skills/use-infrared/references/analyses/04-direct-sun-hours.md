# Direct Sun Hours (direct-sun-hours)

Cumulative number of hours each ground cell receives direct sunlight over the requested time window, accounting for building shadowing. Geometry + sun-position only — no weather file needed.

## Request

```python
from infrared_sdk import InfraredClient
from infrared_sdk.analyses.types import SolarModelRequest, AnalysesName
from infrared_sdk.models import TimePeriod

payload = SolarModelRequest(
    analysis_type=AnalysesName.direct_sun_hours,
    latitude=48.1983,
    longitude=11.575,
    time_period=TimePeriod(
        start_month=6, start_day=1, start_hour=9,
        end_month=6, end_day=30, end_hour=17,
    ),
)
result = client.run_area_and_wait(payload, polygon, buildings=area.buildings)
```

## Response

`result.merged_grid` is a 2D `float` array of cumulative direct-sun hours **summed across the filtered hour set defined by `TimePeriod`** — not per-day, not a fraction. The sum runs over the **cross-product** of months × days-of-month × hours-of-day (cascade filter — see [03-time-period.md](../03-time-period.md)), not a continuous wall-clock range. So `(month=6, day=1..30, hour=11..14)` sums ~120 hours per cell, not ~700. A 3-month, 9 a.m.–5 p.m. window can reach hundreds; an all-day yearly window can reach thousands.

`min_legend` / `max_legend` are the SDK's recommended plot bounds for THIS run, derived from the observed grid distribution — NOT from the window length. A heavily shadowed scene may have a `max_legend` well below the astronomical maximum for the period; a sunny rooftop run will be near it.

## Make it interpretable

The raw cumulative value is hard to read across runs with different windows. Useful derivations:

- **Hours per day** — `cell_hours / number_of_days_in_window`. Universal mental model (5 hrs/day = significant sun, 2 hrs/day = heavily shaded).
- **Fraction of run maximum** — `cell_hours / grid.max()`. Within-run relative ranking, dimensionless 0–1.
- **Fraction of daylight in window** — `cell_hours / theoretical_daylight_hours_at_lat_lon`. Answers "what share of available sun does this spot get?"; needs an external sun-position lookup but is the most physically meaningful normalisation across sites and seasons.

For cross-run comparison always normalise first — never compare absolute hour grids from different `time_period`s.

## Pitfalls

- Request class is `SolarModelRequest`, NOT `SolarRadiationModelRequest`. Identical signature to Daylight Availability — only the `analysis_type` enum changes.
- `latitude` / `longitude` are REQUIRED — they drive sun position.
- For radiation in W/m^2 (intensity, not duration) use Solar Radiation instead.
- Always plot with `min_legend` / `max_legend`, not raw `grid.min()` / `grid.max()`.
- **Low sun angles (early-morning / late-afternoon hours, winter months) on multi-tile polygons can show seam artefacts** — buildings outside a tile's 128 m context margin don't occlude across the tile boundary, so long shadows clip at tile edges. Use `estimate_sun_context_loss(polygon, latitude, longitude, time_period)` from `infrared_sdk.preflight` to score the risk before submitting; avoid framing analyses around horizon hours, or stick to single-tile polygons.
