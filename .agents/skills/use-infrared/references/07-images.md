# Image Generation

Render an analysis result grid to a PNG via the weather-service `gen_grid_image` endpoint. Useful for previews, dashboards, and reports without local matplotlib.

## Generating an image

```python
from infrared_sdk.tiling.merger import grid_to_list

result = client.run_area_and_wait(payload, polygon, buildings=area.buildings)
grid = grid_to_list(result.merged_grid)  # numpy -> nested lists, NaN -> None

img_bytes = client.weather.gen_grid_image(
    grid=grid,
    analysis_type="wind-speed",  # optional: improves color mapping
)

with open("output.png", "wb") as f:
    f.write(img_bytes)
```

`gen_grid_image` returns raw PNG bytes — write directly or wrap in `io.BytesIO` for upload. The `analysis_type` argument is optional but recommended; it picks the correct legend palette and range.

## PWC and TCS extras

For Pedestrian Wind Comfort and Thermal Comfort analyses, `gen_grid_image` accepts two extra optional parameters that select sub-categories of the colour mapping:

- `criteria` — comfort criterion (e.g. Lawson, NEN8100)
- `subtype` — analysis subtype identifier

Pass them through alongside `grid` and `analysis_type` when relevant.

## Pitfalls

- Convert the grid with `grid_to_list(result.merged_grid)` (from `infrared_sdk.tiling.merger`) — **not** `result.merged_grid.tolist()`. The request body is JSON, and `.tolist()` leaves `NaN` for no-data cells (outside the polygon / inside building footprints), which `requests` rejects at send time with `Out of range float values are not JSON compliant: nan`. `grid_to_list` converts `NaN -> None` (so does `result.to_dict()["merged_grid"]` if you prefer the dict form).
- Without `analysis_type`, the server falls back to a generic palette — colours will not match heatmaps in other tools (e.g. Plotly using `min_legend`/`max_legend`).
- Output is a fixed PNG; for vector / interactive plots, render locally from `merged_grid` instead.
- The endpoint is part of the weather service (`client.weather`), not `client.analyses` — don't mix them up.
