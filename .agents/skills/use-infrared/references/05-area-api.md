# Area API

Multi-tile analyses over polygons larger than one 512x512m tile. The SDK auto-tiles, parallelizes calls, and stitches a merged grid.

## Cost preview

```python
preview = client.preview_area(polygon, analysis_type=AnalysesName.solar_radiation)
print(f"Tiles: {preview.tile_count}")
print(f"Estimated time: {preview.estimated_time_s}s")
print(f"Estimated cost: {preview.estimated_cost_tokens} tokens")
```

Returns `AreaPreview(tile_count, estimated_time_s, estimated_cost_tokens)`. Heuristics: 10 tokens/tile, 10 s/tile. `max_tiles_override=N` lifts the default ~100 non-empty cap.

> **Always pass `analysis_type`.** Omitting it defaults to the wind grid (256 m step). For solar / UTCI / TCS / daylight / direct-sun-hours that under-counts tiles by ~4× and under-estimates cost. Added in SDK 0.4.3.

## Basic usage (fetch-once-reuse)

```python
from infrared_sdk import InfraredClient
from infrared_sdk.analyses.types import WindModelRequest, AnalysesName

polygon = {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [[
        [13.4050, 52.5200], [13.4110, 52.5200],
        [13.4110, 52.5254], [13.4050, 52.5254],
        [13.4050, 52.5200],
    ]],
}

with InfraredClient() as client:
    area = client.buildings.get_area(polygon)          # fetch buildings once
    # area.failed_tiles lists any tiles where building fetch failed (empty on full success)
    wind_result = client.run_area_and_wait(
        WindModelRequest(
            analysis_type=AnalysesName.wind_speed,
            wind_speed=10, wind_direction=180,
        ),
        polygon,
        buildings=area.buildings,
    )
    print(wind_result.grid_shape)      # e.g. (768, 1024)
    print(wind_result.succeeded_jobs)
```

## Multi-analysis runs

Pass a list of payloads to pool every submission across types into one 20-worker pool. Same trick for parameter sweeps (e.g. 8 wind directions = `8 x tile_count` jobs in one pool).

```python
results = client.run_area_and_wait(
    [wind_payload, svf_payload, solar_payload],
    polygon,
    buildings=area.buildings,
)
wind_result, svf_result, solar_result = results
```

Per-call cap is `max_workers` (default 20). To exceed it, instantiate multiple `InfraredClient`s in separate threads/processes.

## Polygon requirements

GeoJSON Polygon `{"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[lon, lat], ...]]}`. Single ring (not MultiPolygon), `[longitude, latitude]` order, closed, >=3 unique vertices, no self-intersection. Max ~100 non-empty tiles (override with `max_tiles_override`).

## Tile geometry

| Config                   | Inference | Context | Step | Overlap        | Crop                 |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------- | ---- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Wind (`wind-speed`, PWC) | 512m      | 512m    | 256m | 50% (256m)     | Centre 256x256 cells |
| Solar (all others)       | 512m      | 768m    | 512m | None edge-edge | Full 512x512 cells   |

Cell pitch is 1m. Wind merges from centre crops (default) — for multi-tile wind use `directional_blend` instead, see [Merging strategies](#merging-strategies). Solar tiles butt edge-to-edge with a 128m context margin (per side) for distant-shadow buildings. Cells outside the polygon become NaN.

## Merging strategies

`merge_area_jobs(schedule, *, strategy=..., wind_direction_deg=...)` controls how tile results are stitched. The convenience method `run_area_and_wait` always uses `strategy="default"` (plain centre-crop). To access the other strategies, split into the two-step path (`run_area` → poll → `merge_area_jobs`).

| Strategy | When to use | Required kwarg |
|---|---|---|
| `"default"` | Single-tile polygons; multi-tile solar / UTCI / TCS / PWC / daylight / direct-sun-hours; quick wind sanity checks | — |
| `"directional_blend"` | **Recommended default for multi-tile `wind-speed`.** Argmax + upstream-biased Gaussian — seam artefacts shrink to near-zero. | `wind_direction_deg` (raises `ValueError` if missing) |
| `"directional"` | Multi-tile `wind-speed` when you want a hard winner map (no smoothing) for inspection | `wind_direction_deg` |

`"directional*"` are **wind-speed only** — do not pass for `pedestrian-wind-comfort` or any multi-direction analysis (the algorithms assume a single wind vector).

### Two-step pattern (recommended for multi-tile wind-speed)

```python
import time
from infrared_sdk.analyses.types import WindModelRequest, AnalysesName

schedule = client.run_area(
    WindModelRequest(
        analysis_type=AnalysesName.wind_speed,
        wind_speed=10,
        wind_direction=270,
    ),
    polygon,
    buildings=area.buildings,
)

time.sleep(4)  # let API register jobs before first poll
while True:
    state = client.check_area_state(schedule)
    if state.running == 0 and (state.succeeded + state.failed) >= len(schedule.jobs):
        break
    time.sleep(8)

result = client.merge_area_jobs(
    schedule,
    strategy="directional_blend",
    wind_direction_deg=270.0,   # match the simulation's wind_direction
)
```

`wind_direction_deg` follows the meteorological convention (0 = N, 90 = E, 180 = S, 270 = W). Match the value used in the payload, or the blend mask points the wrong way.

See `cookbook/notebooks/08_wind_merge_strategies.ipynb` for a side-by-side comparison of `default`, `directional`, and `directional_blend` on the same schedule.

## AreaResult fields

| Field            | Type              | Description                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `merged_grid`    | `numpy.ndarray`   | Merged grid, NaN outside polygon           |
| `polygon`        | `dict`            | Source GeoJSON polygon                     |
| `analysis_type`  | `str`             | Analysis type that was run                 |
| `grid_shape`     | `tuple[int, int]` | (rows, cols) of merged grid                |
| `bounds`         | `tuple[float, float, float, float] \| None` | True geographic extent of `merged_grid` as `(min_lng, min_lat, max_lng, max_lat)` — added in 0.4.4. **Use this (not `polygon.bounds`) to place the bitmap in a map viewer** — NE-padding past the polygon's bbox otherwise produces an SW-anchored squash. |
| `succeeded_jobs` / `total_jobs` | `int`  | Job counts                          |
| `failed_jobs` / `skipped_jobs`  | `list[str]` | Failed / non-terminal job IDs  |
| `failed_tiles`   | `list[TileFailure]` | Per-tile failure records: `tile_id`, `row`, `col`, `error`, `phase` — added in 0.4.9. `phase` is a `TileFailurePhase` StrEnum: `submit` / `compute` / `download` / `skipped` (priority `submit > compute > download > skipped`; same `tile_id` never appears twice). Use this — not `failed_jobs → tile_id` reverse-mapping — to identify which tiles produced no usable output. Empty on full success. |
| `min_legend`     | `float\|None`     | Legend min across tiles (use as zmin)      |
| `max_legend`     | `float\|None`     | Legend max across tiles (use as zmax)      |

`result.to_dict()` serializes for JSON (numpy -> nested lists, NaN -> `None`) — this is also the shape `client.weather.gen_grid_image()` expects.

## Why building coordinates differ per tile

When you pass `buildings` to `run_area_and_wait()` / `run_area()`, the same building can appear in multiple tiles with **different coordinate values** — that is correct. For each tile the SDK:

1. Computes the tile's **inference SW offset** relative to the polygon bbox SW (based on the tile's row/col and the step size).
2. Expands the tile's bbox by the **context margin** (0 m for wind, 128 m for solar) — this expanded area is only used to *select* which buildings to include.
3. Tests each building's bbox against the expanded selection area.
4. Deep-copies the building and **subtracts the inference tile's SW offset** from its coordinates, converting from polygon-bbox-SW frame to tile-SW frame.

Building coordinates are always relative to the **inference square** (512×512m), not the context square. A building caught only by the solar context margin sits outside 0–512 m, so its tile-frame x or y will be **negative** — the API needs the position relative to the inference origin to compute its shadow / wind effect. Don't filter negative coordinates out.

## Concurrency and per-call caps

`max_workers` (default 20) is the cap **per `run_area*` call**, not per tile or per payload. A multi-payload call like `run_area_and_wait([8 payloads], polygon)` over a 24-tile polygon still runs 20 concurrent submissions, not 192 — submissions queue against the same pool. To exceed it, instantiate multiple `InfraredClient` objects in separate threads or processes (each with its own pool). The backend also enforces an account-level concurrency ceiling (~100 simultaneous tile jobs by default); contact support if you regularly need more.

## Pitfalls

- Never derive heatmap colour range from the grid — use `min_legend` / `max_legend` as `zmin` / `zmax`. Direct Sun Hours / Daylight cluster near the max and look washed out otherwise. The API may omit these fields; always apply a fallback: `zmin = result.min_legend if result.min_legend is not None else float(np.nanmin(result.merged_grid))`.
- Buildings passed to `run_area_and_wait()` must be in **polygon-bbox-SW frame** (meters from SW corner of bbox). `client.buildings.get_area()` returns them in this frame.
- Solar context margin produces buildings with **negative coordinates** in per-tile frame — that is correct; do not filter them out.
- The 128 m solar context margin is also the **shadow-casting horizon** — buildings further than 128 m from a tile's edge can't occlude into that tile. At low sun angles (early/late hours, winter) shadows on multi-tile polygons may clip at tile seams. Use `estimate_sun_context_loss(...)` from `infrared_sdk.preflight` to gauge the loss before submitting, or fall back to a single-tile polygon.
- Cold start: first request in a session is 2-5x slower (Lambda warm-up).
- `MultiPolygon` is not supported. Split into separate Polygon calls.
